          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Bipolar disorder, formerly known as manic-depressive illness, is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior, and the ability to think clearly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bipolar disorder is a chronic condition that requires lifelong management. It is typically diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood, but symptoms can appear at any age. Common symptoms include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Episodes of mania or hypomania (elevated mood, increased energy).</li>
            <li>Episodes of depression (sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest).</li>
            <li>Mood swings that disrupt daily life.</li>
            <li>Difficulty maintaining relationships or performing at work or school.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Bipolar disorder is treatable, and most people can manage their symptoms with medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes.

          <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
          <p>
            Symptoms of bipolar disorder vary depending on the type of episode (manic, hypomanic, or depressive). Common signs and symptoms include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Manic Episode:</strong> Elevated mood, increased energy, reduced need for sleep, racing thoughts, impulsive behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Hypomanic Episode:</strong> Similar to manic episodes but less severe and not as disruptive.</li>
            <li><strong>Depressive Episode:</strong> Persistent sadness, fatigue, loss of interest, feelings of worthlessness, difficulty concentrating.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Symptoms must persist for a specific duration and significantly impair daily functioning for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.

          <h2>Diagnosis and Tests</h2>
          <p>
            Bipolar disorder is diagnosed based on a thorough evaluation of symptoms, medical history, and behavior. There is no single test for bipolar disorder, but healthcare providers may use:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Questionnaires and interviews.</li>
            <li>Mood charting to track mood swings over time.</li>
            <li>Guidelines from the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Symptoms must:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Persist for a specific duration (e.g., at least one week for mania).</li>
            <li>Significantly impair daily functioning.</li>

          <h2>Management and Treatment</h2>

            Treatment for bipolar disorder typically involves a combination of:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, or antidepressants.</li>
            <li><strong>Psychotherapy:</strong> Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), family-focused therapy, or psychoeducation.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle Changes:</strong> Regular sleep patterns, stress management, and avoiding triggers.</li>
            <li><strong>Support Groups:</strong> Connecting with others who have similar experiences.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
