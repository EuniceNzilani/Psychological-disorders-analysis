          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Such events may include natural disasters, serious accidents, terrorist acts, war/combat, rape, or other violent personal assaults.
          </p>
          <p>
            PTSD can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, or background. Symptoms can be severe and long-lasting, interfering with daily life and relationships. Common symptoms include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Flashbacks or reliving the traumatic event.</li>
            <li>Nightmares or severe anxiety.</li>
            <li>Uncontrollable thoughts about the event.</li>
            <li>Avoidance of places, activities, or people that remind you of the trauma.</li>
            <li>Negative changes in mood and thinking.</li>
            <li>Hyperarousal (feeling on edge, being easily startled).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            PTSD is treatable, and many people recover with proper treatment and support.

          <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
          <p>
            Symptoms of PTSD are generally grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Common signs and symptoms include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Intrusive Memories:</strong> Flashbacks, nightmares, or distressing memories of the event.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoidance:</strong> Avoiding places, activities, or people that remind you of the trauma.</li>
            <li><strong>Negative Changes in Thinking and Mood:</strong> Feelings of hopelessness, memory problems, or detachment from loved ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Changes in Physical and Emotional Reactions:</strong> Being easily startled, feeling tense, or having angry outbursts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Symptoms must persist for more than a month and significantly impair daily functioning for a diagnosis of PTSD.

          <h2>Causes</h2>
          <p>
            PTSD is caused by experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. However, not everyone who experiences trauma develops PTSD. Risk factors include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Intensity of the Trauma:</strong> The more severe and prolonged the trauma, the higher the risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal History:</strong> A history of mental health issues or previous trauma.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Support:</strong> Limited social support after the event.</li>
            <li><strong>Biological Factors:</strong> Genetics or brain chemistry may play a role.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The following are <strong>not</strong> causes of PTSD:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal weakness or character flaws.</li>
            <li>Simply feeling "stressed" or "anxious."</li>
            <li>A lack of willpower.</li>

          <h2>Diagnosis and Tests</h2>
          <p>
            PTSD is diagnosed based on a thorough evaluation of symptoms, medical history, and behavior. There is no single test for PTSD, but healthcare providers may use:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Questionnaires and interviews.</li>
            <li>Psychological evaluations.</li>
            <li>Guidelines from the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Symptoms must:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Persist for more than a month.</li>
            <li>Significantly impair daily functioning.</li>
            <li>Not be attributable to substance use or another medical condition.</li>

          <h2>Management and Treatment</h2>
          <p>
            Treatment for PTSD typically involves a combination of:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Psychotherapy:</strong> Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), or exposure therapy.</li>
            <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, or sleep aids.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle Changes:</strong> Regular exercise, stress management, and building a strong support network.</li>
            <li><strong>Support Groups:</strong> Connecting with others who have experienced similar traumas.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, and help individuals regain a sense of control.

          <h2>Prevention</h2>
          <p>
            While PTSD cannot always be prevented, certain strategies may reduce the risk or severity of symptoms:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Seeking immediate support after a traumatic event.</li>
            <li>Building a strong support network of family and friends.</li>
            <li>Practicing stress-reduction techniques like mindfulness or meditation.</li>
            <li>Seeking professional help early if symptoms arise.</li>
