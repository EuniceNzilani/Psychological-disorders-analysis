          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health conditions characterized by excessive fear, worry, or nervousness. These feelings can interfere with daily activities and are often difficult to control. Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anxiety is a normal response to stress, but when it becomes chronic or overwhelming, it can significantly impact a person's quality of life. Common symptoms include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Excessive worry or fear.</li>
            <li>Restlessness or feeling on edge.</li>
            <li>Fatigue.</li>
            <li>Difficulty concentrating.</li>
            <li>Irritability.</li>
            <li>Muscle tension.</li>
            <li>Sleep disturbances.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Anxiety disorders are highly treatable, and most people see improvement with therapy, medication, or a combination of both.
